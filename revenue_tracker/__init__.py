# src/__init__.py

# This file can be empty, or you can add initialization code here.
# It's only needed to mark this folder as a Python package.

# Optional: If you want to expose functions directly, you could add imports like:
# from .weather import get_today_weather
# from .database import inserisci_incasso, create_table
